# Personal beliefs

Points that I strive to live by.

Roughly in (decreasing) order of importance.
This is a work in progress.

- Say Yes.
Maximize opportunities for great outcomes.

- Don’t worry.
When in doubt, not worrying is better than worrying. Not worrying too much gives you peace of mind and opportunities to experience new things.

- Enjoy life.
Find pleasure in every detail. Don't complain about small things.

- Question yourself.
Practice self-awareness and self-reflection. Not everything you think is the right or only way to look at things.

- Show gratitude and empathy.
Don't take it for granted. Show it with words and actions.

- Be kind to others.
Make people feel appreciated.

- Don’t take everything personally.
The hurtful things people say nearly always have far more to do with their own unhappiness than anything else.

- Be impeccable with your word.
Be honest, don’t lie, only promise what you can keep.

- Accept help.
You might be able to do most things best yourself, but not everything, and sometimes it's impossible to know in advance.

- Don’t make assumptions.
Don’t assume you know what someone is thinking or why they’re acting like they are.

- Listen well and think before talking.
Don't talk for others. Don't give unsolicited explanations. 

- Do your best.
Realizing that your best one one day is not as good as your best on another day.

- Say No.
Don't agree to everything just to avoid conflict.
